				First steps, first steps.

				Today mostly involved some basic setup. I bought a new domain and added it to my existing host. I've done this before and it was very straightforward. I decided that I would use github for the project source hosting and so I set up a new account there and created a repo. I created a new repo in github, through their wizard which was incredibly simple, I then linked to that repo using the freeware app SourceTree. SourceTree has a public repos section with GitHub support, so adding the account was very simple.

				After that I started with my project structure and committed every time I had a logical change.
			</p>
			<p>
				This approach seems to be good as far as getting things out the door. I have not had any troubles finding places to improve, which has been an issue with me in the past. I do anticipate that I am asking for a lot of trouble if I don't reach a point of structure soon. At the moment I have no design goals, nor a bug tracking / feature tracking system. Both of which are vital from a structure point of view.

				There is also no javascript or styles on the homepage at the moment. For the time being I am fine with the lack of consistent style since I don't know what designs will be needed. I think i will put of issues of design until after my first code undertaking: the development of a barebones backbone page. Which I think is a logical place to start my next post. This concept of next post will be my main source of structure for now. If it proves to be a useful construct, I may integrate it into my site. For lack of a better place at the moment, I will keep design priniciple brainstorming and bug/feature lists on the homepage.
