<h1>Getting Started with javascript: Aug. 5, 2012</h1>
<p>
	<ul>What I have as I begin:

		<li>An editor, I'm using <a href="/">Sublime</a> with <a href="/">several plugins</a></li>
		<li>A github repo. Follow along with my commits if you'd like: <a href="/">here</a></li>
	</ul>
	<ul>Post topics:
		<li>Javascript</li>
		<li>Backbone.js</li>
		<li>Jasmine</li>
		<li>Test Driven Development</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Background: I have been developing for a while now in .NET and Java. I have been planning to learn javascript and TDD for some time now as well as the maintenance of a server and a version control system. This blog will be my platform for all of those things. 
</p>
<p>
	Format: The homepage will be edited as I go and probably be more or less a hyperlinked dictionary of my learnings, by topic, with links to any sources I used, and what I used them for. There will also be a blog which will act as a history with brief articles about what I did and learned in a given coding session.
