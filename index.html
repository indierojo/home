</p>
<p>
	Background: I have been developing for a while now in .NET and Java. I have been planning to learn javascript and TDD for some time now as well as the maintenance of a server and a version control system. This blog will be my platform for all of those things. 
</p>
<p>
	Format: The homepage will be edited as I go and probably be more or less a hyperlinked dictionary of my learnings, by topic, with links to any sources I used, and what I used them for. There will also be a blog which will act as a history with brief articles about what I did and learned in a given coding session. There is also an "apps" section which are apps I am developing to learn the technologies. They will be incrementally developed but with limited growth ideas in mind. For example I may have a "Backbone" app which is just the barebones backbone setup. I will also have a seperate "Backbone with Require.js" app which would be a barebones backbone app using require.js. Why I have an app which is static and one which may be changed over time is more or less related to how useful I think the app would be in its current state. Some people may find a use of a barebones backbone app, so if I replace it with the require one, they no longer have said resource.
